## uvc-gadget README

### Dirty hack
This is a dirty and heavily unoptimized fork of https://github.com/hacksider/Deep-Live-Cam
with some lame hack and scripts which add uvc-gadget functionality to the project.
_(pretty sure upstream will have a rtps stream-out functionality soon, which will make the Deep-Live-Cam hack part of this project obsolete)_

*massive la, low fps, no audio...*

I doubt I will spend much time into polishing this and it is too fragile to get it merged into upstream.
You better should wait until someone provides a more straightforward solution - you have been warned :)
It works in my environment at least for some fun, ymmv.

### environment

Deep-Live-Cam is running on a headless pretty strong machine _(*AAA*)_ here. An usb cam is directly connected to it and uses the device node `/dev/video0`.

A separate device is used as uvc-gadget - I use a *rpi4*, which offers otg functionality through the usb-c port.
As the uvc-gadget is attached to a usb-hub which is switched between multiple machines, I use a usb-c splitter cable with pd and otg functionality
_(to keep power for the *rpi4* stable when switching the usb hub)_

_(not every computer has otg support! There is a `dummy_hcd` kernel module which emulates that function, but it seems like it is not uvc compatible)_

### workflow chain:

rpi4:

prepare two video4loopback devices:

```
modprobe v4l2loopback devices="2" video_nr="23,24" max_buffers="8" max_width="640" max_height="480"
v4l2loopback-ctl set-fps 30 /dev/video23
v4l2loopback-ctl set-fps 30 /dev/video24
```

prepare a usb gadget device
there are multiple scripts which could be used _(as an example [this](https://www.raspberrypi.com/tutorials/plug-and-play-raspberry-pi-usb-webcam/) one looks good)_
I successfully used `gadget-uvc` from the [libusbgx](https://github.com/linux-usb-gadgets/libusbgx) project instead

You should end up with a `/dev/video0` gadget device and two v4l2loopback devices:

```
v4l2-ctl --list-devices
fe980000.usb (gadget.0):
	/dev/video0

Dummy video device (0x0000) (platform:v4l2loopback-000):
	/dev/video23

Dummy video device (0x0001) (platform:v4l2loopback-001):
	/dev/video24
```

install ffmpeg, uvc-gadget (I used https://github.com/wlhe/uvc-gadget, but upstream - mentioned in the readme - very likely works as well),
copy 'get-deep-live-cam-stream.py' from this project to /usr/local/bin, adjust it to your needs, make sure the deps are installed and working _(v4l2, pickle)_

To activate your usb gadget the content of /sys/class/udc/ needs to be written to
/sys/kernel/config/usb_gadget/${YOURDEVICENAME}/UDC

your script/tool you use might have already done this for you (`gadget-uvc` did) - just cat the UDC file to find out - on my rpi4:

```
cat /sys/kernel/config/usb_gadget/g1/UDC 
fe980000.usb
```

AAA:

After selecting a face and clicking "Live", Deep-Live-Cam is opening a socket _(on port 9999)_ and is waiting for a client connection before it continues.

rpi4:


terminal 1:

`get-deep-live-cam-stream.py`

_(connects to the socket and streams the received Deep-Live-Cam modified frames into the v4l2loopback device /dev/video23)_

_(the script uses the python 'v4l2' module - it seems to be unmaintained for years and needed some minor manual edits to get it working)_

terminal 2:

`ffmpeg -i /dev/video23 -f v4l2 -vcodec rawvideo -pix_fmt yuyv422 /dev/video24`

_(converts the video format in /dev/video23 to a v4l/uvc gadget compatible format with the v4l2loopback device /dev/video24 as destination)_

terminal 3:

`uvc-gadget -f 0 -o 1 -r 0 -s 1 -v /dev/video24 -u /dev/video0`
_(writes the /dev/video24 video stream into the uvc gadget device /dev/video0, upstream uvc-gadget uses different command line parameters - those used work for me for now)_


*PROFIT*

when everything works as it should, the device, which has the usb-gadget attached now has a working usb webcam with the modified face
_(`1d6b:0104 Linux Foundation Multifunction Composite Gadget` when using `gadget-uvc`)_
Of course no special drivers are required on that device, just use any program which works with webcams.

exiting the program:
kill it with fire


### Deep-Live-Cam v4l2loopback video source 
side hint:

As an alternative to a physical webcam you could as well use any rtsp stream (of a network camera for example) as Deep-Live-Cam source and stream it to a v4l2loopback device.

```
SRC="rtsp://your.rtsp.source:8554/eugen"

if ! lsmod | grep -q v4l2loopback; then
  modprobe v4l2loopback devices="1" video_nr="0" max_buffers="8" max_width="640" max_height="480"
  v4l2loopback-ctl set-fps 25 /dev/video0
fi
ffmpeg -i ${SRC} -f v4l2 /dev/video0
```

## How do I install it?


### Basic: It is more likely to work on your computer but it will also be very slow. You can follow instructions for the basic install (This usually runs via **CPU**)
#### 1.Setup your platform
-   python (3.10 recommended)
-   pip
-   git
-   [ffmpeg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlNWCpFdVMA) 
-   [visual studio 2022 runtimes (windows)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
#### 2. Clone Repository
    https://github.com/hacksider/Deep-Live-Cam.git

#### 3. Download Models

 1. [GFPGANv1.4](https://huggingface.co/hacksider/deep-live-cam/resolve/main/GFPGANv1.4.pth)
 2. [inswapper_128_fp16.onnx](https://huggingface.co/hacksider/deep-live-cam/resolve/main/inswapper_128_fp16.onnx)

Then put those 2 files on the "**models**" folder

#### 4. Install dependency
We highly recommend to work with a  `venv`  to avoid issues.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For MAC OS, You have to install or upgrade python-tk package:
```
brew install python-tk@3.10
```
##### DONE!!! If you dont have any GPU, You should be able to run roop using `python run.py` command. Keep in mind that while running the program for first time, it will download some models which can take time depending on your network connection.

## How do I use it?
> Note: When you run this program for the first time, it will download some models ~300MB in size.

Executing `python run.py` command will launch this window:
![gui-demo](instruction.png)

Choose a face (image with desired face) and the target image/video (image/video in which you want to replace the face) and click on `Start`. Open file explorer and navigate to the directory you select your output to be in. You will find a directory named `<video_title>` where you can see the frames being swapped in realtime. Once the processing is done, it will create the output file. That's it.

## For the webcam mode
Just follow the clicks on the screenshot
1. Select a face
2. Click live
3. Wait for a few seconds (it takes a longer time, usually 10 to 30 seconds before the preview shows up)

![demo-gif](demo.gif)

Just use your favorite screencapture to stream like OBS
> Note: In case you want to change your face, just select another picture, the preview mode will then restart (so just wait a bit).
